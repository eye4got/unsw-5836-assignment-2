# README

Both scripts have been converted from jupyter notebooks. They contain a parameter called minimal_run, which alternates the parameters from those used in graphs in the report (minimal_run=False) and very small values and excluding certain graphs to prove the code works. minimal_run has been set to True in both scripts by default in EdStem. Graphs are still generated (their folders are automatically created) in both run types. Output is separated into graphs/tables, then part A/B.
